# Hello, World!

This is Etched, an opinionated lens on the content you own, create and share. You write and export as a Markdown file, attach it to an NFT on the Solana blockchain, and Etched will provide you a clean, shareable, deeply integrated view on your own content that works across every surface you might want. Your writing is forever yours and its provenance is cryptographically signed with your public key. If you don't like how Etched displays your content, you'll be able to run and fully-host it yourself, too.

When you share content on Etched, folks can annotate the content you've shared, and the annotations they create are theirs (although it is still associated with your writing!). As the author of the original content, you're welcome to choose whether to share all annotations, some annotations, or no annotations; but like well-worn used book, the annotator may choose to share their view of your work, too.

Given the permissionless nature of the blockchain, Etched will always choose to "trust, but verify" any content being displayed. The associated author of any piece of content must verify that they created that content, either by signing the original transaction that created that NFT, or via a separate "verification" instruction. All unverified content will not be surfaced in SEO and large, prominent warnings are displayed to ensure the the safety of the reader.

Etched avoids lock-in, and rather looks to enhance. There are no first-party usernames on Etched; instead, creators may utilize the numerous blockchain-enabled domains / name registries that exist already. For example, pointing `etched.jnwng.sol` to `etched.sol/jnwng.sol` creates a verifiable link between your own domain name and Etched, and Etched will display an archive of all the pieces you've ever created.

Etched goes well-beyond writing and is intended to be a portal to everything beautiful on the blockchain. There are over 100 million etchings already on Solana, all of which are looking to escape their digital confines and live out in the wild. Etched is here to help!
